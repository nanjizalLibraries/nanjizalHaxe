__My Libraries__

# [geom](https://github.com/nanjizal/geom/)
[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)  
Matrices, Vectors. 
   
[![link: source code](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-source%20code-green.svg)](https://github.com/nanjizal/geom/)
[![link: documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-documentation-blue.svg)](https://nanjizal.github.io/geom/pages/) [![link: haxelib](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-haxelib-EA8220.svg)](https://lib.haxe.org/p/geom/)  
  
#### Status  
   
- Works well, have been DualQuaternion, and Quaternion have been looking at implementations for hxMath and some points have been raised so likely some changes need applying soon.     
- Has some Unit Test coverage, could probably do with more.    
- Some non-maths-y structures can be removed as they are now covered in dsHelper.    
- haxelib needs updating soon.   
- ga folder needs removing.

## hxTShopify
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  
Shopify, ideal for private applications, typedef for manipulating shopify stores via electron.  

[![link: source code](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-source%20code-green.svg)](https://github.com/nanjizal/hxTShopify/)
[![link: documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-documentation-blue.svg)](https://nanjizal.github.io/hxTShopify/pages/)    
  
#### Status
 - The library is over a year old, without sponsorship I am unsure I can justify keeping it up to date with Shopify. Would be keen to work with Shopify dev to keep it a useful option, some of the official tools especially in js space are bloated.

## trilateral3  
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  
Abstracted GL drawing engine, draws to Float32Array. 
  
[![link: source code](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-source%20code-green.svg)](https://github.com/nanjizal/trilateral3/)
[![link: documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-documentation-blue.svg)](https://nanjizal.github.io/trilateral3/pages/) 

[history - overview](https://trilateralx.github.io/TrilateralDemos/), [test demos wip](https://github.com/TrilateralX/TrilateralSamples)
  
### Status  
 - Actively improving, have added features towards basic texture support, unsure if ready for haxelib yet.
 - Uses quite a few helper libraries approach needs more consideration.
